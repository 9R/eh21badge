Glueing a shred of space blanket to behind the leds will help to create a snooth cloud illumnation

LEDs on the PCB adjacent to the translucent clouds should be masked with tape. 

## Assembly
* Hold the badge face down and attach the switch cap to the switch
* Hook the stud on the bottom edge of the back cover into the nook of the battery holder
* When pressing the badge towards the cover they should snap together
